# Ethical Considerations in Decision Making

This document explores ethical frameworks and considerations relevant to decision-making.

## Ethical Frameworks

*   **Utilitarianism:** Focuses on maximizing overall good or minimizing harm for the greatest number of people.
*   **Deontology:** Emphasizes duties or rules, regardless of consequences (e.g., universal moral laws).
*   **Virtue Ethics:** Focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than the actions themselves or their consequences.
*   **Rights-Based Ethics:** Centers on the belief that individuals have certain entitlements that should be respected.

## Guiding Questions

*   **Fairness:** Is the decision fair to all stakeholders?
*   **Transparency:** Can the decision and its rationale be openly communicated?
*   **Accountability:** Who is responsible for the decision and its outcomes?
*   **Impact:** What are the potential short-term and long-term impacts on individuals, groups, and the environment?
*   **Integrity:** Does the decision align with core values and principles?
