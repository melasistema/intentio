# Cartoon Universe Immutable Rules: What Must Never Change

This document outlines the foundational and unchangeable rules that define the very essence of the "Cartoon Universe" style. These principles are paramount and must be strictly adhered to by all generated content to maintain the integrity and consistency of the visual grammar. Any deviation from these rules fundamentally breaks the universe's aesthetic.

## I. Absolute Style Lock Enforcement

-   **Consistent Visual Grammar:** The specific rules for line thickness, color palette, shading model, character proportions, perspective handling, and shadow direction (as defined in `line_art_rules.md`, `color_palette_atlas.md`, `shading_model_library.md`, `character_anatomy_ratios.md`, `perspective_flattening_techniques.md`, and `shadow_direction_rules.md`) are absolute and non-negotiable.
-   **No Stylistic Drift:** The style must remain perfectly consistent across all renders, regardless of the subject or scene complexity.
-   **No Hybrid Styles:** Absolutely no mixing with other art styles (e.g., anime, realistic painting, pixel art, 3D render) is permitted.

## II. Fundamental Principles of Form & Color

-   **Bold Outlines:** All primary forms must be defined by clear, bold, and consistently weighted outlines. This is the cornerstone of the universe's graphic appeal.
-   **Flat Color Application:** Colors must always be applied in flat, unbroken fills. Gradients, subtle shading variations, or realistic textures within color areas are strictly forbidden.
-   **Cel-Shaded Aesthetic:** The shading must always be cel-shaded, characterized by hard-edged shadow shapes without blending.

## III. Anti-Realism Mandate

-   **Zero Realism:** Any hint of photographic realism in texture, lighting, anatomy, or perspective is fundamentally antithetical to this universe's style and must be aggressively negated.
-   **Exaggeration & Simplification:** The style thrives on exaggeration and simplification of forms. Natural or anatomically correct rendering is prohibited.

## IV. Core Expressive Qualities

-   **Clear Expressiveness:** Emotional states and actions should be conveyed through clear, often exaggerated, cartoon expressions and body language. Ambiguity is to be avoided.
-   **Readability:** Every element in the scene must be immediately legible and understandable within the cartoon context.

**Enforcement:**
These rules are the bedrock of the Cartoon Universe. They are primarily enforced through:
-   `style_lock_mode` in `manifest.md`.
-   Aggressive use of `negative_guidance_library.md` to suppress realism.
-   Amplification of cartoon traits via `style_token_amplifiers.md` and `cartoon_style_enhancers.md`.
