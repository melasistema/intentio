### 1. Conceptual Core
Define the narrative. What is the story of this single frame?
*Context:* [Analysis of Creative Vision against `past_campaigns.md` and `aesthetic_rules.md` to identify themes, mood, and brand alignment.]

### 2. Director’s Frame (Technical Specs)
Translate the Conceptual Core into technical photographic specifications.
- **Optics:** Consult `camera_atlas.md` for appropriate Focal length, Aperture, and Sensor/Film Stock.
- **Illumination:** Consult `lighting_library.md` for Light quality, Ratio, and Color Temperature.
- **CMF:** Consult `textile_dictionary.md` for Material (Color, Material, Finish) interpretation for key elements.
- **Aesthetics:** Consult `house_style.md` and `aesthetic_rules.md` for Color Palette, Contrast, Composition, and Forbidden Visual Traits.

### 3. Preliminary Flux-2 Master Prompt
A high-status, descriptive paragraph that avoids clickbait keywords, summarizing the above technical specs.
