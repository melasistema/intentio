# Aesthetic Rules for "Veridian Collective"

These are the high-level guiding principles and "forbidden" visual traits that Flux2 must adhere to when generating content for the "Veridian Collective" brand. They ensure consistency and protect the brand's visual identity.

## I. Overarching Principles

-   **Authenticity:** Prioritize realism and naturalism over hyper-stylization or artificial perfection. Images should feel believable and grounded.
-   **Serenity:** Every visual should evoke a sense of calm, peace, and understated beauty. Avoid visual noise or elements that create tension.
-   **Subtlety:** Details should be discovered, not overtly declared. Light, texture, and color should work harmoniously to create an overall impression rather than shouting for attention.
-   **Harmony:** All elements within a composition (color, light, form, texture) must contribute to a unified and balanced aesthetic.

## II. Forbidden Visual Traits (Hard Stops)

-   **Over-saturation/Vivid Colors:** Absolutely no garish, neon, or overly vibrant color palettes. Colors should be muted, earthy, and sophisticated, aligning with the brand's natural aesthetic.
-   **High-Contrast/Gritty Aesthetics:** Avoid harsh shadows, blown-out highlights, or any visual style that suggests grittiness, grunge, or stark drama (unless specifically requested for a highly curated, temporary campaign deviation, and then with extreme caution).
-   **Synthetic/Overtly Digital Textures:** Images must not appear "CGI" or artificially smooth. Even if rendered, the final output must convey natural textures, imperfections, and an organic feel. Avoid plastic-like surfaces unless explicitly for a specific product that demands it.
-   **"AI Art" Tropes:** Eschew common visual clichés associated with generic AI image generation (e.g., uncanny valley faces, excessive glow effects without justification, over-reliance on "cinematic" or "epic" keywords without technical grounding).
-   **Extreme Distortion:** While some lens characteristics (e.g., wide-angle perspective) are acceptable when technically justified (`camera_atlas.md`), avoid any distortion that feels unnatural, experimental, or purely for "effect."
-   **Unnatural Poses/Expressions:** Subjects (if human) must exhibit natural, contemplative, or serene expressions and poses. Avoid forced smiles, overly dramatic gestures, or hyper-sexualized stances.
-   **Chaotic/Cluttered Compositions:** Maintain clean lines, ample negative space, and clear focal points. Avoid busy backgrounds or compositions that feel haphazard.
-   **Harsh Flash/Direct Strobe Look:** No direct, undiffused flash photography simulation. Lighting should always appear natural, soft, or intentionally crafted with diffusion and shaping.

## III. Preferred Visual Traits (Soft Guidelines)

-   **Natural Light Simulation:** Prioritize the look and feel of natural light sources (sunlight, window light, overcast skies) even in studio setups.
-   **Soft Focus/Shallow Depth of Field:** Frequently employed to emphasize subjects and create an intimate, dreamy atmosphere, especially in portraits and still life.
-   **Earth Tones & Muted Palettes:** Predominant use of greens, browns, muted blues, and warm greys.
-   **Tactile Textures:** Emphasize the rendering of fabric weaves, wood grain, stone imperfections, and other natural textures to enhance realism.
-   **Slightly Warm Color Cast:** A subtle shift towards warmer tones (5800K-6200K) often enhances the organic and inviting feel of the brand.
-   **Human Element (Subtle):** When present, the human element should be integrated harmoniously with the environment, conveying peace, introspection, or connection. Often in profile or gazing slightly away from the camera.
