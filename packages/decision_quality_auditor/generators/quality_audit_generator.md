# Quality Audit Generator

This generator conducts a comprehensive audit of a proposed decision, evaluating its quality based on established frameworks and potential pitfalls.

## Instructions:

1.  **Input:** Receive a description of a decision (context, objectives, alternatives considered, chosen path, expected outcomes).
2.  **Context:** Utilize the knowledge base on `decision_frameworks.md`, `cognitive_biases_decision.md`, `risk_assessment.md`, and `ethical_considerations.md`.
3.  **Process:**
    *   Assess if a structured decision-making framework was applied.
    *   Identify potential cognitive biases that might have influenced the decision.
    *   Evaluate the completeness and rigor of the risk assessment.
    *   Consider ethical implications and stakeholder fairness.
4.  **Output:** Provide a structured audit report that highlights strengths, identifies areas of weakness, and points out potential blind spots or unconsidered aspects. The report should refer to specific principles from the knowledge base.
