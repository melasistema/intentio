# Textile Dictionary: Flux2 Material Interpretation

This dictionary guides Flux2 on how to visually interpret various textile and material properties, moving beyond generic descriptions to simulate realistic surface characteristics.

## I. Natural Fibers & Weaves

-   **Linen:**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Coarse, slightly irregular weave visible, subtle slub (thicker threads) throughout. Matte finish, prone to soft, organic creases and wrinkles. Light absorption with minimal specular highlight. Should convey breathability and a natural, unrefined elegance.
    -   **Keywords:** `organic weave`, `matte finish`, `slub texture`, `soft creases`, `breathable`

-   **Organic Cotton (Poplin/Sateen):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:**
        -   **Poplin:** Fine, crisp weave, relatively smooth but not shiny. Holds shape well, subtle drape.
        -   **Sateen:** Smoother surface with a slight, diffused sheen, softer drape than poplin.
    -   **General:** Soft hand, visible but very fine texture. Moderate light absorption, very gentle highlight, should not appear synthetic.
    -   **Keywords:** `fine weave`, `soft hand`, `subtle sheen (sateen)`, `crisp (poplin)`, `natural drape`

-   **Wool (Merino/Cashmere):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Soft, fuzzy surface with visible micro-fibers, particularly for cashmere. Matte to very slight sheen. Excellent drape, often with gentle folds. Merino can show a subtle rib or knit pattern if appropriate. Should convey warmth, luxury, and softness.
    -   **Keywords:** `fuzzy texture`, `soft drape`, `luxurious`, `warm hand`, `fine fibers`

-   **Silk (Charmeuse/Dupioni):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:**
        -   **Charmeuse:** High, lustrous sheen, very smooth surface, extremely fluid drape with soft, flowing folds. Reflects light significantly, creating bright specular highlights that shift with viewing angle.
        -   **Dupioni:** Noticeable slub and irregular texture due to varying thread thickness, moderate sheen, crisp hand.
    -   **General:** Luxurious feel, vibrant color rendition due to light reflection.
    -   **Keywords:** `lustrous sheen (charmeuse)`, `fluid drape`, `rich color`, `slub texture (dupioni)`, `delicate`

## II. Synthetic & Blended Fabrics

-   **Viscose/Rayon:**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Smooth, soft, with a fluid drape similar to silk but typically less sheen. Can appear slightly more matte or have a subtle, even luster. Absorbs dye well, leading to rich, even colors.
    -   **Keywords:** `smooth drape`, `soft feel`, `even luster`, `dye absorption`

-   **Polyester (Microfiber/Satin):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:**
        -   **Microfiber:** Very fine, dense, matte or very slight brushed texture. Can appear slightly absorbent or have a "peach skin" feel.
        -   **Satin (Polyester):** High, often artificial-looking sheen, less natural drape than silk satin. Can appear slightly stiffer or more plastic-like.
    -   **General:** Less breathable appearance than natural fibers.
    -   **Keywords:** `artificial sheen (satin)`, `dense weave`, `smooth surface`, `less natural drape`

## III. Special Materials & Finishes

-   **Obsidian Leather:**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Deep, rich black color with an extremely high, mirror-like gloss finish. Reflects light sharply, showing distinct, small specular highlights. Surface should appear perfectly smooth and taut, conveying luxury, strength, and a modern edge. May show subtle, fine creases on curves, but not deep wrinkles.
    -   **Keywords:** `mirror gloss`, `deep black`, `smooth surface`, `sharp reflections`, `luxury`

-   **Brushed Metal (e.g., Aluminum, Brass):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Matte or semi-matte finish with a visible, unidirectional fine grain or "brush" pattern. Diffused, elongated specular highlights rather than sharp points. Should appear solid, cool to the touch, and sophisticated.
    -   **Keywords:** `matte metallic`, `brushed texture`, `diffused highlight`, `solid`

-   **Ceramic (Glazed/Unglazed):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:**
        -   **Glazed:** Smooth, often reflective surface with a vitreous (glass-like) sheen. Can have subtle imperfections or bubbles under the glaze.
        -   **Unglazed:** Matte, slightly porous texture.
    -   **General:** Solid, weighty appearance. Colors can be vibrant for glazed, earthy for unglazed.
    -   **Keywords:** `vitreous sheen (glazed)`, `porous (unglazed)`, `smooth (glazed)`, `earthy (unglazed)`

-   **Wood (Unfinished/Oiled):**
    -   **Flux2 Interpretation:** Visible wood grain patterns, subtle textural variations.
        -   **Unfinished:** Completely matte, appears dry, can show fine surface fibers.
        -   **Oiled:** Slightly richer color, very subtle, natural luster, not glossy.
    -   **Keywords:** `visible grain`, `natural texture`, `matte (unfinished)`, `subtle luster (oiled)`
