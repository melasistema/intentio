# Chemistry Reference: The Elements of Life

## 1. The Big Four (CHON)
Over 96% of living matter is made of just four elements. Their positions on the Periodic Table dictate their bonding behavior in the cell.

- **Carbon (C):** Group 14. Its 4 valence electrons allow for stable, tetrahedral covalent branching (the backbone of DNA and Proteins).
- **Oxygen (O):** Group 16. Highly **Electronegative** (3.44).
    - *Biological Impact:* Creates polar bonds in water ($H_2O$), leading to hydrogen bonding.
- **Nitrogen (N):** Group 15. Essential for amino acid "amine" groups.
- **Hydrogen (H):** Group 1. The smallest atom, used as a proton ($H^+$) in electrochemical gradients.

## 2. Alkali & Alkaline Earth Metals (The Signalers)
These elements found in Group 1 and Group 2 are the "batteries" of the cell.

| Element | Symbol | Ion | Group | Biological Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sodium | $Na$ | $Na^+$ | 1 | Major extracellular cation; drives action potentials. |
| Potassium | $K$ | $K^+$ | 1 | Major intracellular cation; maintains resting potential. |
| Calcium | $Ca$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | 2 | Intracellular messenger; triggers muscle contraction. |
| Magnesium | $Mg$ | $Mg^{2+}$ | 2 | Cofactor for ATP; stabilizes DNA/RNA structure. |

### Cognitive Hook: The "Charge Density" Link
- **Physics Connection:** The charge ($+1$ vs $+2$) and the **Ionic Radius** determine how easily these ions pass through the "selective pores" mentioned in `biology/cell_structure.md`.
- **Calculations:** Use $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$ (Coulomb's Law) from the Physics module to calculate the attraction between a $Ca^{2+}$ ion and a negative protein binding site.

## 3. Periodic Trends in Bio-Systems
- **Electronegativity:** Increases as you move Right and Up.
    - *Bio-Link:* This is why Oxygen "pulls" electrons in the Electron Transport Chain (Mitochondria).
- **Atomic Radius:** Decreases across a period, increases down a group.
    - *Bio-Link:* Potassium ($K^+$) is larger than Sodium ($Na^+$). This size difference is how "Leaky Channels" in the cell membrane distinguish between them despite both having a $+1$ charge.

## 4. Phosphorus (P) and Sulfur (S)
- **Phosphorus:** Group 15. The "P" in **ATP**. High-energy phosphate bonds are the primary energy storage.
- **Sulfur:** Group 16. Forms "Disulfide Bridges" that lock protein structures into 3D shapes.
