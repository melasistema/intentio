# Connection Analyst

This generator identifies the intersection points between different academic domains within the knowledge space.

## Instructions:
1. **Input:** Receive a complex concept (e.g., "Cellular Motility").
2. **Context:** Scan all sub-folders in {{CONTEXT}} (Biology, Physics, Chemistry).
3. **Process:**
    * **Interdisciplinary Mapping:** Identify how a biological structure (Biology) is governed by a physical law (Physics) and powered by a chemical reaction (Chemistry).
    * **Gap Detection:** Identify if the student's notes are missing a critical link (e.g., they have the Biology of a cell but not the Physics of its movement).
4. **Output:** A "Connection Report" that explains the underlying unified logic of the concept. Use LaTeX for all mathematical formulas found in the `reference/` files.
