# Decision Frameworks

This document outlines various frameworks for structured decision-making.

## Rational Decision-Making Model

1.  **Identify the problem:** Clearly define the issue at hand.
2.  **Gather information:** Collect relevant data and facts.
3.  **Identify alternatives:** Brainstorm possible courses of action.
4.  **Weigh the evidence:** Evaluate alternatives against criteria.
5.  **Choose among alternatives:** Select the best option.
6.  **Take action:** Implement the chosen alternative.
7.  **Review decision and its consequences:** Learn from the outcome.

## Cynefin Framework

*   **Simple:** Clear cause-and-effect, best practice.
*   **Complicated:** Clear cause-and-effect, but requires analysis/expertise.
*   **Complex:** Cause-and-effect only coherent in retrospect, emergent practice.
*   **Chaotic:** No cause-and-effect, novel practice.
