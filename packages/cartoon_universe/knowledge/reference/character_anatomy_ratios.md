# Character Anatomy Ratios: Model Interpretation for Cartoon Universe

This document establishes the consistent anatomical proportions and feature ratios for all characters and sentient beings within the Cartoon Universe, ensuring a unified and recognizable design language.

## I. Core Proportional Rules

-   **Exaggerated Head-to-Body Ratio:** Heads are typically larger in proportion to the body than in reality, often ranging from 1:2 to 1:3 head-to-body height.
    -   **Keywords:** `large head small body ratio`, `exaggerated head size`, `chibi proportions` (if applicable)
-   **Simplified Limbs:** Limbs are often stylized, shorter, and thicker than realistic proportions, or can be noodle-like for extreme flexibility.
    -   **Keywords:** `stylized limbs`, `short thick arms legs`, `noodle limbs`
-   **Defined Silhouettes:** Character forms are simplified into strong, recognizable silhouettes with clear shapes.

## II. Facial Feature Ratios

-   **Large, Expressive Eyes:** Eyes are generally larger than realistic proportions, positioned higher on the face, and highly expressive.
    -   **Keywords:** `large expressive eyes`, `big cartoon eyes`, `high-set eyes`
-   **Simplified Noses & Mouths:** Noses are often small and button-like, or absent. Mouths are wide and highly flexible for exaggerated expressions.
    -   **Keywords:** `small button nose`, `wide expressive mouth`, `simple facial features`
-   **Eye-to-Head Ratio:** The width of each eye is often significantly wider in proportion to the overall head width.

## III. Body Type Simplification

-   **Geometric Shapes:** Bodies are often built from simplified geometric forms (circles, ovals, rectangles) to maintain a graphic quality.
-   **Distinct Body Types:** Clear, exaggerated body types (e.g., pear-shaped, bean-shaped, cylindrical) are consistently applied to archetypes.

## IV. Movement & Flexibility

-   **Squash and Stretch:** Characters should appear capable of extreme squash and stretch, demonstrating high flexibility and cartoon physics.
    -   **Keywords:** `squash and stretch animation style`, `cartoon physics`, `highly flexible character`
-   **Exaggerated Poses:** Poses should be dynamic and exaggerated, conveying emotion and action clearly.

## V. Forbidden Realistic Traits

-   **Anatomically Correct Proportions:** Strictly avoid realistic human or animal anatomy.
-   **Subtle Facial Expressions:** Expressions should be clear and exaggerated, not nuanced or subtle.
-   **Detailed Muscle/Bone Structure:** No underlying anatomical detail should be rendered.
-   **Keywords (Negative):** `no realistic anatomy`, `no subtle expressions`, `no detailed musculature`, `no realistic body proportions`

**General Proportional Principles for the Image Generation Model (Cartoon Universe):**

-   **Consistency is Key:** Once a set of ratios and exaggerations is established for a character or species, it must be maintained across all renders.
-   **Expressive Simplification:** The goal is expressive power through simplification and exaggeration, not realistic depiction.
-   **Enforce with Style Lock:** These rules are fundamental for character consistency.
