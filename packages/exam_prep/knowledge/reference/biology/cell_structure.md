# Biology Reference: Cell Structure and Energetics

## 1. The Mitochondria (The Powerhouse)
The mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles found in most eukaryotic organisms. They generate most of the cell's supply of **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, used as a source of chemical energy.

### Cognitive Hook: Bio-Physics Connection
- **Mechanism:** ATP synthesis involves the movement of protons across a membrane.
- **Physics Link:** This movement is a form of *Work* ($W$) and involves *Electric Potential* ($V$).
- **Exam Note:** If calculating the efficiency of a cell, refer to the **Thermodynamics** formulas in the Physics folder.

## 2. The Cytoskeleton and Motility
The cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibers (microtubules, actin filaments) that extends throughout the cytoplasm. It provides structural support and enables **Cell Motility**.

### Cognitive Hook: Kinematics Connection
- **Motor Proteins:** Kinesin and Dynein act as molecular motors that "walk" along microtubules.
- **Physics Link:** These motors exert a measurable **Force** ($F$) to move vesicles of a specific **Mass** ($m$).
- **Calculations:** Movement is often non-linear. Refer to `physics/kinematics.pdf` for equations regarding *Velocity* ($v$) and *Acceleration* ($a$).

## 3. The Cell Membrane
A biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment.

### Cognitive Hook: Chemistry Connection
- **Composition:** Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
- **Chemistry Link:** The "head" is hydrophilic (polar) and the "tail" is hydrophobic (non-polar).
- **Interaction:** Refer to `chemistry/periodic_table.md` to understand why certain ions (like $Na^+$ and $K^+$) require active transport versus passive diffusion based on their **Electronegativity**.

## 4. Key Terminology for Exam Prep
- **Organelle:** A specialized subunit within a cell.
- **ATP:** The energy currency of life.
- **Diffusion:** Movement of particles from high to low concentration (Entropy).
