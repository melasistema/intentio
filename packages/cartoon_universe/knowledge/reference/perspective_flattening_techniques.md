# Perspective Flattening Techniques: Model Interpretation for Cartoon Universe

This document outlines the approach to perspective and depth within the Cartoon Universe, favoring simplified, graphic representations over photorealistic spatial rendering. The goal is clarity and consistent stylized depth.

## I. Simplified Perspective Models

-   **Orthographic/Isometric View:**
    -   **Model Interpretation:** Objects and scenes are often rendered without true vanishing points, presenting a flattened, diagrammatic view. Parallel lines remain parallel.
    -   **Keywords:** `orthographic projection`, `isometric view`, `flat perspective`, `no vanishing points`
-   **Limited Vanishing Points (One-Point Perspective Emphasis):**
    -   **Model Interpretation:** When perspective is used, it's typically very simple, often adhering to one-point perspective principles to maintain clarity. Extreme foreshortening is generally avoided.
    -   **Keywords:** `simplified one-point perspective`, `graphic depth`, `minimal foreshortening`
-   **Layered Depth:**
    -   **Model Interpretation:** Depth is primarily conveyed through clear layering of elements (foreground, mid-ground, background) and relative scaling, rather than complex atmospheric or linear perspective cues.
    -   **Keywords:** `layered background elements`, `clear foreground midground background separation`, `relative scaling for depth`

## II. Absence of Atmospheric Perspective

-   **Clear Edges for Distance:** Distant objects maintain sharp outlines and vibrant colors, rather than fading into the background with atmospheric haze.
    -   **Keywords:** `sharp edges distant objects`, `vibrant colors in background`
    -   **Negative Keywords:** `no atmospheric perspective`, `no aerial perspective`, `no distant haze`, `no fading colors in background`

## III. Camera Angle & Framing

-   **Clear, Unobtrusive Angles:** Camera angles are chosen for maximum clarity of the subject, avoiding dramatic, low-angle, or high-angle shots that distort proportions (unless a specific stylistic choice is enforced within `character_anatomy_ratios.md`).
-   **Static Composition:** Compositions are generally static and balanced, emphasizing the subject rather than dynamic camera movement.
-   **Keywords:** `clear balanced composition`, `static camera angle`, `direct view`

## IV. Forbidden Realistic Depth Cues

-   **Complex Linear Perspective:** Avoid multiple vanishing points, extreme depth of field, or highly realistic architectural perspective.
-   **Realistic Shadow Play for Depth:** Shadows are for form definition and stylized, not for conveying realistic spatial relationships or complex light sources.
-   **Volumetric Effects:** No volumetric fog, light shafts, or other effects that create photorealistic depth.
-   **Keywords (Negative):** `no complex linear perspective`, `no deep depth of field`, `no realistic light shafts`, `no photorealistic spatial rendering`

**General Perspective Principles for the Image Generation Model (Cartoon Universe):**

-   **Clarity over Realism:** The priority is always to make elements clear and legible, even if it means sacrificing realistic spatial representation.
-   **Consistent Application:** Once a perspective approach is chosen (e.g., isometric), it must be consistently applied across all elements in a scene.
-   **Enforce with Style Lock:** These rules help maintain the flat, graphic look of the universe.
