# Cartoon Universe Style Guidelines

These guidelines define the fundamental visual grammar for the entire Cartoon Universe cognitive environment. Adherence to these rules is paramount for ensuring consistent style across all generated images, regardless of subject matter.

## I. Core Aesthetic Principles

-   **Universally Recognizable:** All elements, from characters to objects and environments, must immediately read as part of this specific cartoon style.
-   **Clear Readability:** Forms and actions should be easily understood.
-   **Expressive but Consistent:** While allowing for dynamic expression, the underlying visual rules must remain constant.

## II. Line Art Rules (Refer to `line_art_rules.md`)

-   **Consistent Line Weight:** Lines should maintain a uniform thickness, typically medium-heavy.
-   **Clean & Crisp:** Lines must be sharp, without fuzziness or varying opacity.
-   **Outlines:** Strong, defined outlines for all major forms.

## III. Color Palette Bounds (Refer to `color_palette_atlas.md`)

-   **Limited Palette:** A defined set of colors is used, avoiding photographic gradients or subtle shades.
-   **Flat Colors:** Colors are generally flat, without complex textures or highlights/shadows within a single color area.
-   **Vibrant & Saturated:** Colors should be lively and distinct, contributing to the overall cheerful tone.

## IV. Shading Model (Refer to `shading_model_library.md`)

-   **Cel Shading:** Primary shading method, characterized by distinct, hard-edged shadow shapes without blending or gradients.
-   **Minimal Shadow:** Shadows are simple, graphic shapes, primarily for defining form rather than mood or realism.

## V. Character & Object Proportions (Refer to `character_anatomy_ratios.md`)

-   **Exaggerated Features:** Heads, eyes, limbs may be disproportionately large or small for comedic or expressive effect.
-   **Consistent Ratios:** Once established, these exaggerated ratios must be consistently applied to all characters and objects.
-   **Simplification:** Complex forms are simplified into basic geometric shapes.

## VI. Perspective & Depth (Refer to `perspective_flattening_techniques.md`)

-   **Simplified Perspective:** Often uses flattened perspective or orthographic views to emphasize clarity over realistic depth.
-   **Clear Layering:** Elements are clearly layered to indicate foreground, middle ground, and background without complex atmospheric effects.

## VII. Shadow Direction Rules (Refer to `shadow_direction_rules.md`)

-   **Single Light Source:** Implied single, consistent light source for all shadows.
-   **Graphic Shadows:** Shadows are stylized, often simplified shapes that follow the contours of the form.

## VIII. Forbidden Realism Traits (Refer to `negative_guidance_library.md`)

-   Photographic textures, realistic lighting, subtle gradients, natural skin tones, complex material reflections, and any elements that break the cartoon illusion. These are systematically negated.
