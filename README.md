_A private cognitive environment. Not a chatbot. Not a cloud service. A mindset._

----------

## What is INTENTIO?

INTENTIO is a **local-first, private AI system** designed to operate inside a carefully constructed knowledge space.

It does not try to know everything. It tries to understand **one context well** — the one _you_ design.

INTENTIO is not about artificial intelligence as spectacle. It is about **attention, structure, and restraint**.

----------

## A Different Philosophy

Most AI systems are built as oracles:

-   Global knowledge

-   Generic answers

-   Invisible data flows


INTENTIO rejects that model.

Instead, it treats AI as:

> An interpreter of meaning inside a bounded cognitive space.

This space is:

-   **Private** — nothing leaves your machine

-   **Local** — models and embeddings run on your hardware

-   **Intentional** — structure matters more than scale

-   **Inspectable** — every component can be understood


Private AI is not a feature. It is an architectural decision.

----------

## What INTENTIO Is Not

-   ❌ A chatbot trained on the internet

-   ❌ A "chat with your PDFs" demo

-   ❌ An autonomous agent pretending to think

-   ❌ A cloud-dependent service


INTENTIO does not simulate consciousness. It does not improvise identities. It does not speculate beyond its boundaries.

----------

## What INTENTIO Is

-   ✅ A **cognitive instrument**

-   ✅ A **local retrieval-and-reasoning engine**

-   ✅ A system that values **structure over scale**

-   ✅ A tool for designing _how_ AI pays attention


The same engine can become:

-   A research assistant grounded in primary sources

-   A personal archive that remembers carefully

-   A legal or technical analyst that refuses to speculate

-   A creative collaborator shaped by metaphor, not noise


Not because the model changes — but because the **context does**.

----------

## Core Ideas

### 1. Context Is the Intelligence

A modest local model with excellent context beats a massive model with none.

INTENTIO treats:

-   folders as **signals**

-   metadata as **epistemic boundaries**

-   retrieval as **attention**, not search


You are not organizing files. You are teaching the system _what matters_.

----------

### 2. Structure Creates Trust

Clear separation between:

-   facts and opinions

-   memory and reference

-   speculation and evidence


This structure produces:

-   stable tone

-   predictable behavior

-   value alignment


Intelligence emerges from constraint.

----------

### 3. Restraint Is a Feature

INTENTIO prefers:

-   fewer documents

-   smaller models

-   limited retrieval

-   explicit boundaries


Because meaning survives only when it is respected.

----------

## Architecture Overview

-   **Language:** PHP (explicit, boring, honest)

-   **LLM:** Local open-source models (via HTTP)

-   **Embeddings:** Local, inspectable, deterministic

-   **Storage:** Local filesystem + vector index


No cloud calls. No silent training. No external APIs.

Your data stays where it belongs.

----------

## How It Works (Conceptually)

1.  You design a knowledge space

2.  Documents are ingested with meaning-aware structure

3.  Text is embedded locally

4.  Retrieval selects _relevant attention_, not everything

5.  The model responds **only within provided context**


If something is not in the space, INTENTIO does not pretend it knows.

----------

## This Is Not a Revolution

We are not inventing intelligence. We are not defeating Big Tech. We are not chasing benchmarks.

We are quietly reframing the question:

> "In what kind of cognitive space do we want AI to operate?"

That shift is small. But it changes everything.

----------

## Design Principles

-   Privacy over convenience

-   Explicit over magical

-   Local over global

-   Meaning over performance

-   Restraint over spectacle


----------

## Status

INTENTIO is under active development.

This repository represents:

-   an experiment in cognitive design

-   a refusal of unnecessary complexity

-   a belief that AI should adapt to humans — not the opposite


----------

## Final Note

INTENTIO will not shout. It will not promise enlightenment. It will not pretend to be alive.

It will simply say:

> "Here is a private space. Fill it with meaning. I will respect it."

Sometimes, that is revolutionary enough.
