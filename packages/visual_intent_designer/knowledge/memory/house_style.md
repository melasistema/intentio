# House Style: "Veridian Collective"

## Visual DNA: Understated Modernism with Organic Touch

**Brand Essence:** Elegance, Sustainability, Serenity, Authenticity.

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Deep Forest Green (#1B4D3E), Muted Clay (#B08968)
- **Secondary:** Soft Ivory (#F8F8F8), Charcoal Grey (#36454F)
- **Accent:** Faded Gold (#D4AF37, used sparingly)

**Lighting Signature:**
- **Quality:** Predominantly soft, diffused natural light, often directional from a single large source (window light, large softbox).
- **Ratios:** Low contrast, typically 2:1 to 3:1 key-to-fill ratios to maintain a gentle gradient.
- **Mood:** Evokes calm, introspection, and warmth. Never harsh or overly dramatic.

**Compositional Principles:**
- **Rule of Thirds:** Often respected, but with subtle breaks to encourage visual flow.
- **Negative Space:** Abundant and intentional, allowing subjects to breathe.
- **Depth:** Achieved through shallow depth of field, especially in portraits, isolating the subject while hinting at an environment.

**Texture & Material Interpretation (Flux2):**
- **Natural Fibers:** Linen, organic cotton, un-dyed wool – emphasize subtle variations, slub, and soft tactile qualities.
- **Reflective Surfaces:** Brushed metals (brass, matte silver), glazed ceramics – render with diffused, soft specular highlights, avoiding harsh reflections.
- **Wood:** Unfinished or lightly oiled, showcasing grain and natural imperfections.

**Post-Production/Grading:**
- **Color Temperature:** Slightly warm (5800-6200K) to enhance organic feel.
- **Tones:** Gently lifted shadows, subtle desaturation of primary colors (especially reds and blues), with greens and earthy tones slightly emphasized.
- **Contrast:** Medium-low, preserving detail in both highlights and shadows.
- **Sharpening:** Minimal, natural fall-off, no artificial "crispness."
- **Grain:** Very fine, subtle film-like grain can be introduced for organic texture, if appropriate for the campaign.

**Forbidden Visual Traits:**
- Over-saturation or garish colors.
- High-contrast, gritty, or "grungy" aesthetics.
- Synthetic, overtly digital, or futuristic visual elements.
- Harsh, direct flash photography look.
- Distorted or overly stylized perspectives (e.g., extreme wide-angle distortion).
