# Improvement Generator

This generator focuses on suggesting improvements for an existing "hook" based on identified weaknesses.

## Instructions:

1.  **Input:** Receive a "hook" and optionally, an analysis of its weaknesses (e.g., from the Analysis Generator).
2.  **Context:** Utilize the knowledge base on `hook_models.md`, `cognitive_biases.md`, `audience_dimensions.md`, and `evaluation_rules.md`.
3.  **Process:**
    *   Identify specific areas for improvement based on the provided analysis or an internal assessment against the evaluation rules.
    *   Suggest concrete modifications or alternative phrasings.
    *   Explain *why* the proposed changes are improvements, referencing the principles from the knowledge base (e.g., "This change improves clarity by...", "This leverages FOMO by...").
4.  **Output:** Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing the hook. Focus on making it more effective.
