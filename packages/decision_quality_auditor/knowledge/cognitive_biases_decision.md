# Cognitive Biases in Decision Making

This document lists cognitive biases particularly relevant to decision-making processes.

*   **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking out or interpreting information in a way that confirms one's own preconceptions.
*   **Anchoring Bias:** Over-relying on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
*   **Framing Effect:** Drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented.
*   **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing to invest in a failing project because of past investments of time, money, or effort.
*   **Availability Heuristic:** Overestimating the likelihood of events with greater "availability" in memory (i.e., those that are more easily recalled).
*   **Groupthink:** When a group of intelligent people makes irrational decisions because of a desire for harmony and conformity.
