# Evaluation Rules for Hooks

When evaluating a hook, consider the following rules:

1.  **Clarity:** Is the message clear and easy to understand? Does it avoid jargon?
2.  **Attention Capture:** Does it immediately grab the reader's attention? What mechanism does it use (e.g., surprise, curiosity, strong statement)?
3.  **Emotional Resonance:** Does it evoke a relevant emotion (e.g., hope, fear, joy, curiosity)?
4.  **Relevance:** Is it relevant to the target audience's needs or interests?
5.  **Conciseness:** Is it as short and impactful as possible without losing meaning?
6.  **Uniqueness:** Does it stand out from competitors or common messaging?
